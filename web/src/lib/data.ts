export const SYSTEM_BRIEF = `# System Brief — payments-platform

A bank payments platform that moves money via ACH (RBC rail) and card (Stripe).
Requests enter through the **api-gateway**, are validated by **orders-module**,
and queued through **RabbitMQ** to **payments-service**, which drives the
transfer state machine, calls external rails, and posts to the **ledger-service**.

## Shape
- 1 edge gateway, 4 internal services, 2 queues, 2 data stores
- 5 external dependencies (RBC, Stripe, Plaid, SendGrid, Identity Provider)

## Top 3 Risk Areas
1. **payments-service → rbc-rail-adapter** — synchronous, external, no circuit
   breaker. Latency here hits users directly.
2. **auth-layer** — hard dependency for every request, unclear ownership.
3. **env-config → payments-service** — RBC_API_KEY referenced but not found in
   any scanned vault.

## Scan Confidence
Most of the core path is confirmed. The Stripe webhook, Plaid path, and the
secret injection boundary are inferred or uncertain — verify before relying.
